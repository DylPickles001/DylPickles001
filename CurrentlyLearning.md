# What I'm currently learning!
## C++
Currently I'm trying to get a hang of the syntax and incorporation of different classes. I believe Python has spoiled me syntactically,
so learning C++ will hopefully be a rewarding experience!
As for applying my C++ knowledge, I hope to create more faster and efficient versions of my Python programs, as
it's commonly known that C++ is much faster than Python. Also, I'm partially interested in Competitive Programming to some degree,
so having a faster language could help.
I suffered a great deal of Tutorial Hell and hope to end that by doing hands-on stuff for now. I'm hoping to do the same for Java.

Current thoughts on C++:
Having completed watching and taking notes of MIT 6.0001 Intro to CS and Python, I feel having knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming is an essential part in even scratching a surface in understanding an ounce of C++.

## Java
I'm currently devoting more time with C++ first as I believe once I become somewhat fluent in C++, Java should be no issue for me to get used to.
So far Java is looking more wordy, but it looks like with more practice I'll get a better hang of it.
With gaining Java knowledge, I definitely want to use that knowledge to build Android Apps.
I got lots of ideas, but I can't execute them yet.

## C#
C# is a language applicable for Unity and making games. Syntactically C# shares many similarities with Java, so learning both actually kills 2 birds with 1 stone.

## (Seriously Lagging) Data Structures and Algorithms
This is actually very important. Coding interviews operate off of these concepts.
Honestly I've made very little progress in this area and only have a "rudimentary" knowledge of what 'Big O' Notation' is, but nothing to write home about.

Reflecting on some Hacker rank challenges, I feel a knowledge of algorithms beforehand is more helpful.

# DylPickles001

Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm someone who's interested in learning more about computers and coding. In school I learned rudimentary skills in HTML and Python to create basic websites and programs, but I hope to acquire knowledge on other languages, their importance, and how to incorporate them in the real world. 

## What I'd like to learn

GitHub from what I can tell is an incredible source of information on coding and especially for learning. Personally for the future I'd like to desire something in CyberSecurity or Software Development. From what I can tell, CyberSecurity and Software Development both contain their differences, but I'd like to gain more knowledge on these fields and maybe determine what I'd stick with for a career prospect. 

Anything among programming applications, learning what programming languages stand for, learning what certain tasks programming languages can do, and learning skills I can apply towards real-life or strive towards greater learning and career prospects is especially desirable.

## What I do know

Very little.. Hahaha 
As stated previously, I currently only have very basic knowledge of how to create a basic website and program with HTML and Python respectively. I took AP Computer Science Principles in high school so I have some exposure to algorithms and boolean logic while learning how to do hexadecmial/binary conversions, but I honestly either forgot that information or don't know how to really apply that knowledge, so any sort of implementation advice would be helpful.

## Projects
### GPA Calculator (working)-

link to program: https://GPA-Calculator.dylannguyen5.repl.run
This came to mind when I wanted to make a simple program that asked for grades that the user had, then simply calculate their GPA. I got inspired to make this while in College App season, so we can calculate our GPA easily in a more interactive way. With this program, you can calculate your weighted or unweighted GPAs.

### Position/Velocity/Acceleration calculator (currently a work in progress)-
link to replit code: https://repl.it/@DylanNguyen5/Position-Velocity-Acceleration-calculator
link to program: https://position-velocity-acceleration-calculator.dylannguyen5.repl.run/
I got inspired to make this for my AP Calc and physics class, which often required the same computational process, but I wanted to see if I could make a program that could accelerate/enable a way to computate or solve these problems in a more efficient way or to check certain answers to problems on tests that I had.               

#### Thank you for any tips or assistance!

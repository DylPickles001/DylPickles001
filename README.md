# DylPickles001

Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm someone who's interested in learning more about computers and coding. In school I learned rudimentary skills in HTML and Python to create basic websites and programs, but I hope to acquire knowledge on other languages, their importance, and how to incorporate them into the real world. 

## What I'd like to learn

GitHub from what I can tell is an incredible source of information on coding and especially for learning. Personally for the future I'd like to pursue something into Software Development. I'd like to gain more knowledge and determine if this is what I would stick with for a career prospect. 

Anything among programming applications, learning what programming languages stand for, learning what certain tasks programming languages can do, and learning skills I can apply towards real-life or strive towards greater learning and career prospects is especially desirable.

As of current, I'm attempting to complete some MIT OCW CS courses such as 6.0001 to get CS basics, although I also hope to learn more about data structures and algorithms and C++ to maybe get into some competitive programming ventures. 

## What I do know

Very little.. Hahaha 
As stated previously, I currently only have very basic knowledge of how to create a basic website and program with HTML and Python respectively. I took AP Computer Science Principles in high school so I have some exposure to algorithms and boolean logic while learning how to do hexadecmial/binary conversions, but I honestly either forgot that information or don't know how to really apply that knowledge, so any sort of implementation advice would be helpful.


## Projects
My projects currently only exhibit basic Python skills, although I have yet to express knowledge of recursion, effective loops, or classes, I hope to improve the functionality of my projects by doing so in the future.

### GPA Calculator (working)-

This came to mind when I wanted to make a simple program that asked for grades that the user had, then simply calculate their GPA. I got inspired to make this while in College App season, so we can calculate our GPA easily in a more interactive way. With this program, you can calculate your weighted or unweighted GPAs.

### AP Lit Grade Calculator (working)-

This program definitely came to mind when my fellow AP Lit classmates and I worried about our AP Lit grades. This is especially due to our teacher hiding our final grades to us until we receive a report card. What I realized was that our category grades were actually still avaliable and he graded us in a weighted grade style, so I based the program's operation on calculating based on the specific weights that my teacher gave from our syllabus. Another interesting thing to note is the differences of the weight in categories by semester, since in our 2nd semester, we had to do a senior 'project' of a sort and reaching AP exam season. Please note that this program is specially for AP Lit students at my school, but the principles that were used in creating this program could definitely be incorporated in finding a grade of a class that incorporates a grade by weight scale to your liking.

### Garden of Emotions: Typed out Poem (working)-

This came into fruition initially after reading East of Eden, one of my favorite books that I read in AP Lit. I wrote a poem that synopsized the early parts of the novel, but I felt it was a great way to apply what I just read. I definitely owe a great deal to the creators of the ant simulator, who created a game program (also written in Python) that involved typing out stuff onto the console.

### Position/Velocity/Acceleration calculator (currently a work in progress)-
link to replit code: https://repl.it/@DylanNguyen5/Position-Velocity-Acceleration-calculator
link to program: https://position-velocity-acceleration-calculator.dylannguyen5.repl.run/
I got inspired to make this for my AP Calc and physics class, which often required the same computational process, but I wanted to see if I could make a program that could accelerate/enable a way to computate or solve these problems in a more efficient way or to check certain answers to problems on tests that I had.               

#### Thank you for any tips or assistance!

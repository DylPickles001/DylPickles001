# DylPickles001

Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm someone who's interested in learning more about computers and coding. In school I learned rudimentary skills in HTML and Python to create basic websites and programs, but I hope to acquire knowledge on other languages, their importance, and how to incorporate them in the real world. 

## What I'd like to learn

GitHub from what I can tell is an incredible source of information on coding and especially for learning. Personally for the future I'd like to desire something in the CyberSecurity field or maybe get glimpses of Software engineering. From what I researched there's definitely differences among the two, but I'd like to gain more knowledge on these fields and maybe determine what I'd stick with for a career prospect.

Anything among programming applications, learning what programming languages stand for, learning what certain tasks programming languages can do, and learning skills I can apply towards real-life or strive towards greater learning and career prospects is especially desirable.

### What I do know

Very little.. Hahaha 
As stated previously, I currently only have very basic knowledge of how to create a basic website and program with HTML and Python respectively. I took AP Computer Science Principles in high school so I have some exposure to algorithms and boolean logic while learning how to do hexadecmial/binary conversions, but I honestly either forgot that information or don't know how to really apply that knowledge, so any advice would be helpful.

### Projects in Progress

Position/Velocity/Acceleration calculator-

                https://position-velocity-acceleration-calculator.dylannguyen5.repl.run/
I got inspired to make this for my AP Calc and physics class, which often required the same computational process, but I wanted to see if I could make a program that could accelerate/enable a way to computate or solve these problems in a more efficient way or to check certain answers to problems on tests that I had.               

#### Thank you for any tips or assistance!

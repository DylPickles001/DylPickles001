# Notes on C++
Here I'll insert any informative or mind-blowing/boggling think I discover about C++.

## Potential Updates
Recently, I've been working on Edabit Challenges for C++. I'll begin posting the solutions I got for several of their challenges on a repository. I think Edabit and their challenges are a great resource for learning programming languages (such as C++) and definitely provide a more proactive and interactive way of learning. Definitely through practicing on this website on a daily basis, tutorial hell is abstained!
